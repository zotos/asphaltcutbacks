# Our History
Asphalt Cutbacks Inc. (ACI) is a family-owned and operated company that has been supplying high-quality industrial asphalts and industrial cutbacks to the industry since 1984. Founded and established by George N. Bizoukas in Hammond, IN, we have built a reputation for excellence and reliability in the asphalt industry.

Initially, ACI produced only "cutback asphalt," but over the years, we have expanded our offerings to include a multitude of industrial graded asphalts, either blended or oxidized (air-blown). Today, we are proud to offer our customers a wide range of top-quality raw materials for their asphalt-based products.
