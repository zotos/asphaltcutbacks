Roofing asphalt is a widely used material for flat roofs, providing excellent protection against the elements and weather. One popular type of roofing system that utilizes asphalt is built-up roofing (BUR). BUR consists of multiple layers of reinforcing fabric, known as felts, that are bonded together with hot asphalt.

# Built-Up Roofing: A Time-Tested Solution for Flat Roofs

Built-up roofing (BUR) is a type of roofing system that has been used for over 100 years to provide durable and reliable protection for flat and low-sloped roofs. BUR consists of multiple layers of reinforcing fabric, known as felts, that are bonded together with hot asphalt.

The number of felts used in a BUR system can vary depending on the specific needs of the project, but typically ranges from three to five layers. The felts are typically made of organic materials, such as wood or cellulose, or synthetic materials, such as fiberglass.

The layers of felts are then embedded in hot asphalt, which acts as a waterproofing agent and helps to hold the layers together. Once the layers are installed, a top layer of gravel or mineral granules is often added to provide additional protection against the sun's UV rays and to help the roof resist weathering.

## Benefits of Built-Up Roofing

There are several benefits to using built-up roofing for flat roofs, including:

- Durability: BUR is a time-tested roofing system that has been used for over a century. When properly installed and maintained, a BUR roof can last 20-30 years or more.

- Versatility: BUR can be installed on a wide variety of flat and low-sloped roofs, including commercial and industrial buildings, as well as residential homes.

- Fire resistance: BUR systems are highly fire-resistant, thanks to the use of multiple layers of asphalt and felts.

- Energy efficiency: BUR roofs can help to reduce energy costs by providing excellent insulation and reducing the need for heating and cooling.

- Low maintenance: BUR roofs require minimal maintenance, which can help to reduce long-term costs and extend the life of the roof.
