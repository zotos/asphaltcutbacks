      <description>Cutback asphalt is a type of asphalt that has been blended with a solvent, usually a petroleum-based solvent, to make it more fluid and easier to apply. This type of asphalt is commonly used in a variety of applications, including pipe coating, industrial coatings, and roofing.
Common uses In pipe coating, cutback asphalt is applied to the surface of pipes to provide protection against corrosion and other environmental factors. The solvent in the asphalt helps to penetrate the surface of the pipe, creating a durable and long-lasting barrier.</description>
